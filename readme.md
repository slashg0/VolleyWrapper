_I'm a Volley wrapper for Android_



This library is the by-product of a project I was working on as a novice Android Developer. I had to integrate requests to some RESTful APIs using Volley. I felt that coding in each request was a little tedious, especially with the organisation of request structure, common parameters and response structures. 

I wrote some code to simplify these and ended up with a good potential library that eventually worked as the Spine for the heavily API controlled app. It immediately got title **Spine** in my head.

This project lay abandoned for a long time when I had to use it again for another project. I wasn't so novice this time and decided to convert it to an independent library instead of just copying source files every time. Hence, this repo.

The library is now available on JCenter. To add to your app, simply add this to dependencies in your `build.gradle`

*`compile 'xyz.slashg.spine:spine:0.12'`*

The library is in quite a nascent stage at present and I wholeheartedly welcome the open-source community to help me make it better.

Thanks for spending your time on _Spine_!
